# Dino Game AI & Player Mode  

This project is a clone of the popular Google Chrome "No Internet" Dino game, featuring both an AI-powered mode and a manual player mode. The AI is trained using the *EAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm, allowing it to learn and improve its ability to navigate obstacles over multiple generations.  

This project serves as an introduction to AI-driven gameplay and evolutionary algorithms, demonstrating how machine learning techniques can be applied to classic games.

## Features  
- **AI Mode** – Uses NEAT to train an AI that learns to jump over obstacles and improve its survival time.  
- **Player Mode** – Allows users to play the game manually, replicating the experience of the original Google Dino game.  
- **Obstacle Avoidance** – The AI learns to recognize and react to obstacles such as cacti and birds.  
- **Neural Network Visualization** – Displays the AI's decision-making process in real time.  

## How It Works  
- The AI **evolves over multiple generations**, improving its performance based on a fitness scoring system.  
- The fitness function rewards survival time and penalizes collisions with obstacles.  
- Players can switch between AI mode and manual mode for different gameplay experiences.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Python**  
- **Pygame** for graphics and game mechanics  
- **NEAT-Python** for AI training and evolution
